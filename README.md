# Ares opensourced for better use
I've decided to opensource Ares Requesting system, I don't manage Ares anymore, in this case others can maintain the source and working of it.
The code is worse and pain in the ass and is not completly mine.
I just made major modifications and added a lot of features to it.
The System works, but is slow as f*ck.
